Expressjs(ek npm pkg hai)->Framework
what is Framework? gives you flow
Definition: A framework is a pre-defined structure or skeleton that provides a foundation for building applications. 
It dictates the architecture of your application and how your code should interact with it.

Frontend: Angular, Vue.js

Middleware can serve static assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
Middleware can control the number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame to prevent abuse.

Session and Cookie
Session data saved on server side
Cookie data saved on client side

Sessions are used to store data on the server-side, and a unique session ID is usually stored in a cookie or URL to identify the session for a particular user.
Life Cycle: Sessions last until the browser is closed or the session expires (can be configured on the server).
Usage: Sessions are typically used for:
User authentication (storing logged-in users’ information).
Storing temporary data (e.g., shopping cart contents).
Maintaining state between different pages or visits.

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in the browser of the user. They are typically used to store user-specific information that needs to persist between page reloads and across different sessions.

Storage: Stored in the browser as name-value pairs.
Life Cycle: Cookies can be persistent or session-based:
Session Cookies: Only available during the current browser session. They are deleted when the browser is closed.
Persistent Cookies: Stored on the user’s device with an expiration date, and they persist even after the browser is closed.
Usage: Cookies are commonly used for:
Remembering login credentials.
Tracking user preferences (e.g., language settings, theme).
Analytics tracking (e.g., Google Analytics).
Storing small data to maintain state or pass information between pages.
